The land itself is steeped in history; once part of the St Clair of Rosslyn estate granted by Robert the Bruce, it eventually became the private parkland of the Trotter family. The course captures this grand estate feeling, weaving through mature silver birches, firs, and pines that frame views of the Pentland Hills and the Firth of Forth.\r\n\r\nThe course\'s architectural pedigree is a \"who\'s who\" of Scottish golf. Its early layout was shaped by the legendary Willie Park Jr. and J.H. Taylor, before being further refined by the great James Braid. In the 1970s, Fred W. Hawtree added modern flourishes, ensuring the par-72 championship layout remained a robust test for contemporary equipment. This evolution has made Mortonhall a frequent host for elite competitions, including the Scottish Amateur Stroke Play Championship and various national youth tournaments.\r\n\r\nBeyond its competitive record, Mortonhall is famous for its storied membership and unique connections. During the First World War, it is believed that the celebrated war poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen played rounds here while recovering at nearby Craiglockhart. Today, the club is known for its vibrant social atmosphere and its historic clubhouse, which provides a stately finish to one of Scotland\'s most meticulously conditioned parkland experiences.', ''),
