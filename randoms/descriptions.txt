The course is natural and unpretentious, reflecting the wild beauty of Speyside. It isn't a championship venue in the traditional sense, but it represents the "soul" of Scottish estate golf—a private playground carved out of a majestic Highland landscape. It is the perfect retreat for those who want to practice their game in total isolation surrounded by mountains.

Founded in 1891, the course is a physical test, with steep climbs rewarded by panoramic vistas of the Cumbrae islands and the Ayrshire coast.

The club is famous for its Royal Hotel Trophy, a prestigious open competition that attracts players from across the region. The greens are small and tricky, often protected by the natural contours of the hill rather than artificial bunkers. It is a traditional "village" club where the atmosphere is as memorable as the elevation changes, embodying the grit and beauty of Argyll golf.

Innerleithen
Innerleithen Golf Club is a delightful 9-hole course set in the Leithen Valley in the Scottish Borders. Designed by the three-time Open Champion Willie Park Jr. and established in 1886, it is a masterclass in utilizing a river as a natural hazard. The Leithen Water meanders through the course, coming into play on several holes and providing a soothing soundtrack to the round.

The course is known for its "Rockies" feel, as it is surrounded by high hills on all sides. While it is a 9-hole layout, it features varying tee positions for the second nine to create an 18-hole experience. The opening par-three is notoriously difficult, requiring a shot over a road and a river. It is a friendly, scenic, and historic club that offers a tranquil escape in one of the most beautiful valleys in the Borders.

Insch
Insch Golf Club is a hidden treasure in the shadow of the spectacular Dunnideer Hill and its ancient hillfort. Founded in 1906 as a 9-hole course, it was extended to a full 18 holes in 1997, a project that transformed it into a modern parkland test with a distinct "Highland edge." The layout is split between the older, flatter holes and the newer section, which climbs the hillside to offer panoramic views across the Garioch valley toward the peak of Bennachie.

The course is known for its narrow, tree-lined fairways and exceptionally tricky greens. While it may not have a "celebrity" architect, the quality of the layout is a testament to the dedication of the local community who built it. Insch has gained a reputation for its conditioning, often described as a "mini-Gleneagles" by those who discover it. The signature 13th hole, "Bennachie View" requires a precise drive to a sloping fairway and provides one of the most photographed vistas in Aberdeenshire. It is a welcoming, traditional club where the spirit of the local village is as strong as the challenge on the course.

Inverallochy
Inverallochy Golf Club is a pure, traditional links located on the rugged coast of the Buchan peninsula. This is a course where the sea is your constant companion; it is situated so close to the water that sea spray often coats the greens. Originally a 9-hole course, it was extended to 18 holes by the legendary James Braid in the 1920s. Braid utilized the natural sand dunes and the firm, sandy turf to create a layout that feels as though it was discovered rather than built.

The course has a unique "out and back" routing that is heavily influenced by the North Sea gales. It is a short par-63, but the lack of length is more than compensated for by the tight fairways and the encroaching gorse. Inverallochy is famous for its six par-threes, each playing in a different direction to ensure the wind never attacks the same way twice. Notable members have included several titans of the local fishing industry, and the club maintains a rugged, unpretentious atmosphere. For those seeking the rawest form of links golf in a remote, beautiful setting, Inverallochy is an absolute must-play.

Inveraray
Inveraray Golf Club offers a truly regal setting on the shores of Loch Fyne. This 9-hole parkland course is located within the grounds of the historic Inveraray Castle, the ancestral home of the Duke of Argyll. Established in 1893, the course was redesigned in the 1920s by James Braid, who was invited by the Duke to create a layout worthy of the spectacular estate. The result is a course that winds through mature woodland and along the shoreline, offering views of the castle and the surrounding mountains that are second to none.

The course is famous for its peaceful, secluded atmosphere; you are more likely to hear the cry of an eagle or the splashing of a seal than any urban noise. While it is not a long course, Braid's strategic bunkering and the natural undulations of the estate land require a thoughtful approach. The 19th hole, located in the village, is a favorite for visitors who want to sample the world-famous local seafood after their round. It is a quintessential Highland estate course that blends high-level architecture with the timeless elegance of one of Scotland's most famous historical landmarks.

Invergordon
Invergordon Golf Club is a lush parkland course situated on the shores of the Cromarty Firth. The club's history is inextricably linked to the military; the land was formerly used as a naval base during both World Wars, and the clubhouse was once a naval officer's mess. The 18-hole course was designed by the prolific J.R. Stutt, who was a close associate of James Braid. Stutt took advantage of the mild coastal climate to create a course that features an extraordinary array of mature trees and rhododendrons, making it a spectacular sight in the spring.

The course is known for its wide fairways and large, receptive greens, which are often cited as some of the best-conditioned in the Highlands. It has a "resort" feel, offering a more relaxed challenge than the punishing links of the nearby Moray Firth. One of the highlights is the view of the massive oil rigs being refurbished in the Firth, a unique industrial backdrop that contrasts with the natural beauty of the course. Invergordon is a friendly, community-focused club that provides a high-quality, scenic round of golf for players of all abilities.

Inverness
Inverness Golf Club is the premier parkland venue in the capital of the Highlands. Established in 1883, the course was significantly redesigned by George Smith and later refined by James Braid in the 1930s. Braid's influence is clear in the strategic bunkering and the clever routing that makes the course feel remarkably secluded despite its proximity to the city center. It is a classic parkland layout, characterized by its narrow, tree-lined fairways and the Culcabock Burn, which comes into play on several of the most challenging holes.

The club has a long history of hosting top-tier amateur and professional events, including the Northern Open and the Scottish North District Championships. Notable members have included several Scottish internationalists, and the club maintains a high standard of etiquette and tradition. The signature hole, the par-four 14th, requires a precise drive to avoid the trees and a nerve-wracking approach over the burn. With its magnificent clubhouse and a reputation for fast, true greens, Inverness Golf Club offers a polished and professional golfing experience that serves as the perfect centerpiece for a Highland golf tour.

Inverurie
Located in the heart of the "Garioch" Inverurie Golf Club is a scenic parkland course that offers spectacular views of the Don Valley and the peaks of the Grampian Mountains. Originally established as a 9-hole course in 1902, it was expanded to 18 holes in the 1920s with input from the legendary James Braid. The course is built on a hillside, providing a variety of lies and a physical test that requires a fair degree of fitness. The fairways are lined with a mix of broom, gorse, and mature woodland, giving the course a colorful and natural feel.

Inverurie is known for its firm, well-draining turf and its remarkably consistent greens. The club has produced many talented golfers over the decades and remains a competitive hub in the Aberdeenshire region. The signature hole is the 18th, a challenging par-four that requires a climb back toward the elevated clubhouse, offering a dramatic finish to the round. It is a traditional, friendly club that prides itself on its accessibility and its warm "North East" welcome. For those who enjoy the challenge of undulating terrain and the beauty of the Highland foothills, Inverurie is an essential stop.

Irvine Ravenspark
Located just inland from the famous Bogside links, Irvine Ravenspark is a high-quality municipal course that offers a fascinating hybrid of links and parkland golf. Opened in 1907 to provide accessible golf to the local community, the course was refined by the esteemed architect J.R. Stutt. It features the same sandy, free-draining soil as its illustrious neighbor, ensuring excellent playing conditions year-round. While the front nine has a more open, links-like feel, the back nine moves into a more wooded environment with several challenging water hazards.

Ravenspark has a strong reputation for producing high-caliber amateur talent, including several Scottish internationalists. The course has frequently hosted regional qualifying for the Open Championship and the Scottish Public Courses Championship. One of the highlights of the round is the stretch of holes that run alongside the River Irvine, requiring precise club selection and a steady nerve. It is a friendly, inclusive club that prides itself on offering a championship-standard test at a public price point. For many local golfers, Ravenspark is the "people's favorite" providing a varied and engaging round of golf in the heart of Ayrshire.

Isle of Gigha
The Isle of Gigha Golf Club offers one of the most unique and remote golfing experiences in the world. This 9-hole course is situated on a community-owned island off the Kintyre peninsula. Established in the early 20th century, the course is a "natural links" in the truest sense, with the routing dictated by the rugged shoreline and the ancient rocky outcrops of the island. The views from the course—stretching across the Atlantic to the Isles of Islay and Jura—are simply breathtaking and often distract golfers from their game.

The course is famous for its lack of formality; there are no tee times, and the "honesty box" for green fees reflects the island's relaxed and trusting atmosphere. The layout is quirky and challenging, featuring blind shots and small greens that are perched on natural plateaus. It is a place where you can find total peace, with the only sounds being the waves and the wind. For the "golfing adventurer" a trip to Gigha is a mandatory pilgrimage to play a course that has remained unchanged by modern design, offering a pure and atmospheric connection to the origins of the game.

Isle of Eriska (9-Hole)
The Isle of Eriska offers what is arguably the most exclusive and picturesque short-course experience in the British Isles. Located on a private 300-acre island off the west coast near Oban, the 9-hole course is part of the world-renowned Isle of Eriska Hotel and Spa. The course was designed by Howard Swan and is intended to provide a luxury recreational experience for guests of the estate. It is a "hidden" course in the most literal sense, accessible only by a private bridge that connects the island to the mainland.

The holes wind through ancient woodland and along the rugged shoreline, offering views of Loch Linnhe and the Morvern mountains that are nothing short of cinematic. While it is a shorter course, the island's terrain provides natural defenses, with rocky outcrops and the sea breeze adding to the difficulty. It is a favorite haunt of celebrities and high-profile guests seeking total privacy. Playing here is less about the scorecard and more about the atmosphere—the scent of wild garlic in the air, the sight of golden eagles overhead, and the absolute silence that comes with playing on your own private island.

Isle of Seil
Located just over the famous "Bridge Over the Atlantic" the Isle of Seil Golf Club is a quirky and charming 9-hole course that defines community-led golf. Formed in 1995 after residents realized the island's potential for a local track, it was built primarily through the manual labor of its members. The course occupies the site of a 1910 layout that had been lost to time. It is a parkland-style course set on a working farm, meaning players must often negotiate the local livestock alongside the undulating fairways.

While it does not have a "celebrity" architect, the routing was cleverly devised by the founding committee to maximize the views of the Slate Islands. The club is a pioneer in modern golf governance, having been one of the first in Scotland to consistently elect female captains based purely on merit. Its most notable tournament is the Highland Arts Burns Crystal, an 18-hole open that draws players from across Argyll. It is a "social" club in the best sense, where the 19th hole is often as important as the first, making it a favorite for those touring the Inner Hebrides.

Isle of Skye
The Isle of Skye Golf Club, originally known as Sconser, sits in the dramatic shadow of the Cuillin Mountains. The course was designed in 1964 by the esteemed Dr. Frank Deighton, a former Walker Cup player and one of Scotland's most talented amateur golfers. Deighton's layout is a masterful use of a narrow strip of coastal land, offering a 9-hole experience with eighteen different tee positions that completely change the angle of attack for the second loop.


The club has a rugged history; for years, electric fences were required around the greens to keep the local sheep at bay. In 1987, the club rebranded to its current name to better reflect its status as the island's premier golfing destination. Famous for its "Sea Hole" where a wayward slice will see your ball vanish into the Raasay Sound, the course is a visual masterpiece. Deighton was so fond of his creation that his ashes were scattered on the fairways following his passing in 2018. It is a course that requires a low ball flight and a steady nerve, particularly when the Highland mist rolls off the peaks.


Jedburgh
Jedburgh Golf Club is a scenic parkland course that embodies the quiet dignity of the Scottish Borders. Founded in 1893, the course was significantly improved in the early 20th century with input from the legendary Willie Park Jr., a two-time Open Champion. Park's influence is seen in the clever use of the natural slopes of the Dunion hill, ensuring that very few lies are ever truly flat. The course is famously divided by the Jed Water, which provides a serene soundtrack to a round that is often quite taxing on the legs.

The club has long been a pillar of the Borders golfing community, producing numerous regional champions. It is known for its "Lothian" greens—slick, undulating surfaces that require a soft touch. While it may not host the massive professional events of the coast, it is a regular venue for the Borders Golfers' Association championships. The clubhouse, overlooking the historic abbey town, offers a warm, traditional welcome. For those who enjoy the "mountain goat" style of golf where elevation change is the primary hazard, Jedburgh is a classic example of late-Victorian inland design.

Keith
Keith Golf Club in Banffshire has a history of resilience. The original 1901 course was lost to the "Dig for Victory" campaign during World War II, but the club was resurrected in the 1960s thanks to a generous land donation from Colonel G.B. Kynoch. The current 18-hole layout was designed by Roy Phimister, the professional at Nairn, who created a parkland course that feels significantly more mature than its years. It is characterized by the Drum Burn, which snakes through the property and creates several "do or die" approach shots.

The club is a focal point for the local distilling community, with many members hailing from the world-famous Strathisla and Glenkeith distilleries. The layout is relatively short but notoriously tight, with gorse and broom punishing any lack of discipline off the tee. One of its most famous features is the 6th hole, which requires a blind shot over a corner of "Out of Bounds" territory to reach a green perched on a steep bank. It is an honest, welcoming Highland club that rewards accuracy and strategic play over raw distance, making it a favorite for local society outings.

Kelso
Kelso Golf Club offers one of the most unique settings in Scotland, as much of the course is situated within the perimeter of the Kelso Racecourse. Established in 1893, the course was significantly refined by James Braid, who managed to weave a challenging 18-hole parkland layout around the jumps and the grandstands. This proximity to the "sport of kings" gives the course a grand, expansive feel, with the flat racecourse land providing a fast-playing surface that stays remarkably dry even in the winter.

The club has a prestigious reputation in the Borders and has hosted the Scottish Seniors' Championship. Because the course is largely flat, it is an easy walk, but Braid's signature "crater" bunkers and the occasional racecourse rail provide plenty of strategic obstacles. Famous visitors over the years have included many of the UK's leading jockeys and trainers, who often squeeze in a round between races. It is a course of two halves: the holes inside the track are wide and inviting, while those outside the rails are tighter and more technical. Kelso is a masterclass in sharing space, offering a refined and historic golfing experience.

Kemnay
Kemnay Golf Club is a lush, expansive parkland course in Aberdeenshire that has evolved significantly since its founding in 1908. While it began as a modest 9-hole track, it was transformed into a premier 18-hole venue in the 1990s under the guidance of architect Graeme Webster. Webster's design philosophy—"playability for all"—is evident here, with generous fairways that allow for a fun round while still incorporating enough bunkers and water to challenge the low handicapper.

The course is famous for its "Amen Corner" stretch near the end of the round, where the 16th, 17th, and 18th holes can ruin a good scorecard. The 18th in particular, a par-four with a daunting approach over a pond to a green in front of the clubhouse, was a later addition by Webster that provided the course with a truly dramatic finish. Kemnay is a frequent host of the Aberdeenshire County Championships and is widely regarded as having some of the most consistent greens in the North East. It is a friendly, modern club that manages to feel like a private estate, offering a high-quality, polished parkland experience.

Kilbirnie Place
Kilbirnie Place Golf Club, situated in the hills of North Ayrshire, is a course built on industrial pride. Founded in 1923, the course was established largely by and for the workers of the local steelworks. Originally a 9-hole course on the site of an old estate, it was extended to 18 holes by the members themselves, who hand-cleared the land to ensure the club's survival. This "DIY" history has resulted in a course with a rugged, honest character that follows the natural, rolling contours of the Garnock Valley.

The course is known for its spectacular views toward the Firth of Clyde and the mountains of Arran. While it lacks a "famous name" architect, the layout is highly respected for its natural defense; the "Place" burn comes into play on several holes, requiring precise iron play. The club maintains a fiercely loyal membership and a reputation for being one of the most welcoming in the West of Scotland. It is the perfect example of a "working man's" course that has matured into a scenic and testing parkland gem, proving that great golf is often born from the passion of its players.

Killermont
Killermont is the historic home of the Glasgow Golf Club, the 9th oldest in the world. The course was laid out in 1903 by the legendary Old Tom Morris and was famously his final full course design before his passing. Set within the grounds of a magnificent B-listed Georgian mansion that serves as the clubhouse, Killermont is a sanctuary of traditionalism. It is a pure parkland experience, characterized by massive, ancient trees and the winding River Kelvin, which guards several of the greens.


The club has hosted the Scottish PGA Championship and the Scottish Amateur, and its membership roll is a "who's who" of Glasgow's professional history. Unlike the club's other course at Gailes, which is a links, Killermont is a tactical, refined test that emphasizes placement over power. One of its most daunting features is the 2nd hole, a par-three of over 240 yards that remains one of the toughest one-shotters in the country. To play Killermont is to walk in the footsteps of the "Grand Old Man of Golf" on a canvas that has remained largely untouched for over a century.

Killin
Killin Golf Club is widely considered one of the most scenic 9-hole courses in the British Isles. Established in 1911 and situated at the heart of the Breadalbane region, the course was laid out with advice from John Duncan, the professional at Stirling. The course is a Highland parkland masterpiece, featuring dramatic elevation changes and views of the Falls of Dochart and the surrounding peaks of Ben Lawers. It is a course that doesn't just ask you to play golf; it asks you to admire the landscape.

The club has a rich community history, having been founded by a diverse group that included the local schoolmaster, the gamekeeper, and the minister. The signature hole is the par-three 9th, "The Chasm" where players must hit from an elevated tee over a deep, wooded ravine to a green perched on the hillside. While it hasn't hosted international professional tours, it is a favorite for visitors and was famously a haunt of the novelist Sir Walter Scott's descendants. It is an atmospheric, rugged, and intensely beautiful course that embodies the wild heart of Perthshire golf.

Kilmacolm
Kilmacolm Golf Club is a stunning moorland course that feels like a Highland escape just half an hour from Glasgow. Established in 1891, the layout was refined by the prolific James Braid, who capitalized on the rugged, undulating terrain of the Knapps. The course is a riot of color in the summer, with purple heather and yellow gorse framing the fairways. Because it sits on high ground, it offers expansive views across the Clyde Valley to the peaks of Ben Lomond and the southern Highlands.

The club has a prestigious history and has produced many fine players, including the 1935 Scottish Amateur champion Jack McLean. The course is notoriously difficult to play to your handicap, as the springy turf and natural hollows create unpredictable lies. One of its most famous features is the "Valley of the Shadow" a deep natural ravine that must be negotiated on the back nine. It is a traditional, friendly club that prides itself on maintaining Braid's strategic vision, offering a "pure" golfing experience where the wind and the terrain are the primary defenders.

Kilmarnock Barassie - Hillhouse
The Hillhouse course at Barassie consists of nine holes that, when combined with the nine holes of the "new" loop, create a second full 18-hole experience at this prestigious club. Despite being the "secondary" layout, Hillhouse is maintained to the same exacting championship standards as the main links. It offers a slightly different character, blending traditional links turf with areas that feel more like a sheltered heathland course, providing a varied and engaging round for those who have already tackled the main championship track.

Hillhouse is particularly popular with members for a quick, competitive game and serves as an excellent venue for junior development. It shares the same sandy, free-draining soil that makes Barassie playable throughout the year. While it may lack the international spotlight of the Open Qualifying holes, it features several tricky par-threes and tight fairways that demand precision. It is the perfect example of the "depth of quality" found at Scotland's premier golf clubs, ensuring that every golfer—from the high handicapper to the elite amateur—has a world-class surface to play on.

Kilsyth Lennox
Kilsyth Lennox Golf Club is a rugged and scenic parkland-moorland hybrid that sits at the foot of the Kilsyth Hills. Founded in 1905, the course was redesigned and extended to its current 18-hole form in the 1970s. The layout is characterized by significant elevation changes, offering spectacular views across the Kelvin Valley toward the city of Glasgow and beyond. The course is built on a series of natural terraces, meaning you will often find yourself hitting from elevated tees to greens tucked into the folds of the hills.

While it hasn't hosted the major professional tours, Kilsyth Lennox has a reputation for producing tough, resilient golfers who excel in the Stirlingshire county circuits. The course is known for its "Burn holes" where the local water system creates natural hazards that require careful management. It is a traditional, community-focused club that offers a warm welcome to visitors. The 13th hole, "The Spectacles" is a highlight, requiring a blind shot over twin mounds to reach the green. It is a course that rewards local knowledge and a steady nerve, offering a high-value, authentic Scottish golfing experience.

Kingarrock Hickory
Kingarrock Hickory Golf is a unique time-capsule and the only course of its kind in Europe. Located at Hill of Tarvit Mansion in Fife, this 9-hole course is played exclusively with original wooden-shafted hickory clubs and authentic low-compression balls from the 1920s. The course was originally the private plaything of the Sharp family, who owned the estate, but it was lost to farming during the war and only painstakingly restored in 2008 using the original 1924 plans.

There are no modern amenities here—no yardage markers, no graphite shafts, and no oversized heads. Golfers are provided with a heritage bag containing five clubs: a brassie, a mashie, a niblick, a mid-iron, and a putter. Playing Kingarrock is a masterclass in the "art" of the game over the "science." Notable visitors have included golf historians from around the world seeking to experience the game as Bobby Jones or Walter Hagen would have played it. It is a peaceful, nostalgic experience that reminds every golfer that the heart of the game is about feel, creativity, and a touch of luck.

Kinghorn
Kinghorn Golf Club is a delightful seaside links that offers one of the most enjoyable "walks with a view" in Fife. Founded in 1887, the course was originally designed by the legendary Old Tom Morris. It is a short but tricky layout that clings to the cliffs and hillsides overlooking the Firth of Forth. Because of its elevation, the wind is a constant and formidable opponent, often turning a modest par-four into a grueling struggle for par.

The course is municipal in nature, meaning it remains a vital part of the local community. While it lacks the length of championship tracks, it features some of the most memorable holes in the region, including several that require shots across deep coastal ravines. The view toward Edinburgh and the Bass Rock is a constant companion throughout the round. Kinghorn is proof that Old Tom Morris could create a challenging and engaging layout on any piece of land, regardless of size. It is a friendly, accessible course that provides a high-octane links experience without the high-octane green fee.

King James VI
King James VI Golf Club holds the distinction of being the only golf course in the world situated on a river island. Located on Moncreiffe Island in the middle of the River Tay in Perth, the club was founded in 1858 and the course was designed by Old Tom Morris in 1897. Access to the course is via a narrow walkway attached to a railway bridge, which immediately sets the tone for a unique golfing adventure. The island setting means the course is perfectly flat, but it is surrounded by the rushing waters of the Tay and lined with mature trees.

The club is steeped in history and was named after the Scottish monarch who was a known enthusiast of the game. Because it is an island, the course has a unique microclimate and is famously lush and green throughout the summer. It has hosted many regional championships and is a favorite for those seeking a tranquil, "secret" golfing experience right in the heart of the city. While the river rarely comes directly into play, the psychological pressure of playing on an island—and the occasional sound of the trains overhead—adds a fascinating layer of character to this historic Old Tom Morris gem.

Kings (Inverness)
Kings Golf Club in Inverness (formerly Torvean) is a relatively new addition to the Highland golf scene but one that has made a massive impact. Opened in 2019 to replace the old municipal course, the layout was designed by Stuart Rennie. It is a modern, championship-standard parkland course that was built to rival the quality of the famous links nearby. Rennie utilized the rolling terrain to create a "stadium" feel, with large, undulating greens and expansive white sand bunkers that give it a very high-end, professional look.

Despite its young age, Kings has already hosted several prestigious amateur events and is a regular venue for the PGA Highlands Open. The course offers spectacular views over the city of Inverness and the Caledonian Canal. The signature hole is the par-three 14th, which plays across a valley to a well-guarded green. The modern clubhouse is a hub of activity and reflects the club's ambition to be a premier golfing destination. It is the perfect example of how modern design can create a challenging, visually stunning course that complements the traditional Highland landscape.

Kings Acre
Located on the southern outskirts of Edinburgh, Kings Acre is a modern parkland course and academy that has become a center for golf development in the Lothians. Opened in the late 1990s, the course was designed by Graeme Webster and features a layout that is both challenging for the low-handicapper and accessible for the casual player. The design is characterized by large, USGA-spec greens and several significant water hazards that require strategic navigation.

Kings Acre is perhaps best known for its world-class academy and practice facilities, which have attracted many of Scotland's leading professionals for practice sessions. The course itself is beautifully manicured and offers views toward the Pentland Hills. It has a "commercial" feel in the best sense—professional, well-organized, and focused on providing a high-quality experience. The par-five 18th is a fantastic finishing hole, requiring a brave approach over water to reach the green in two. It is a popular choice for corporate days and for golfers in the capital who want a polished, modern round of golf without the formality of an ancient private club.

Kingsfield
Kingsfield Golf & Leisure, located near Linlithgow, is a vibrant and modern facility designed to foster a love for the game.

Its most distinctive feature is the railway line that runs parallel to several holes, adding a touch of Victorian industrial charm to the lush surroundings.

It is a friendly, well-established club that rewards accuracy and stamina, offering a quintessential "city parkland" round with a historic pedigree.

Kings Links
Kings Links is a historic coastal course that provides the city of Aberdeen with a pure links experience right on its doorstep. As one of the oldest sites of golf in the world—with records of the game being played here as far back as 1625—it is a place of immense heritage. The current 18-hole layout is a traditional "out and back" links, running parallel to the North Sea beach. It is a flat, walking-friendly course characterized by firm turf, hidden pot bunkers, and the ever-present, biting coastal wind.

The course is municipal in nature, meaning it has served generations of Aberdonians as a training ground for the more famous links nearby. While it may not host the professional tours, its defense lies in its exposure to the elements; on a calm day, it is a delight, but in a gale, it is a formidable test of low-ball flight. It is famously free-draining, making it a popular choice for year-round golf. For visitors, Kings Links offers an authentic, "no-frills" connection to the origins of the game, played on land that has seen over 400 years of golfing history.

Kingussie

The course is natural and unpretentious, reflecting the wild beauty of its surroundings. There is no "famous" architect here; instead, the terrain dictates the play, with natural burns and steep banks serving as the primary hazards.
