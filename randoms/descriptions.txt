Mar Hall
Mar Hall Golf & Spa Resort is home to the Earl of Mar course, a five-star championship parkland layout that graces the banks of the River Clyde. Designed by the renowned architect Dave Thomas—the man behind the Brabazon at The Belfry—the course was carved out of 240 acres of ancient wooded estate in 2010.

The layout is notoriously "friendly" with fewer hazards and more generous fairways than its coastal neighbors, making it a favorite for beginners and senior golfers. However, the gentle rolling terrain requires a bit of local knowledge to master the slopes. The club is a pillar of the local community, and its professional staff are often involved in regional development programs. For those following the "Braid Trail" or exploring the historic heart of Ayrshire, Maybole provides a tranquil and affordable "stroll in the park" that captures the unpretentious spirit of Scottish municipal golf.
